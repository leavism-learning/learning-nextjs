This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this?
This was a playground to learn Next.js and Firebase. It was a message board web app that implemented Firebase's storage and authentication. I also had opportunities to practice some of Next.js's different page rendering methods.
